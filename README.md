# GHunt Companion
Load all needed cookies to use GHunt peacefully, fast.

This development of this extension has followed Firefox guidelines to use the Promise-based WebExtension/BrowserExt API being standardized by the [W3 Browser Extensions](https://www.w3.org/community/browserext/) group, and is using [webextension-polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) to provide a **cross-browser compatibility** with no changes.\
Therefore, this extension has a **single branch for all browsers**.

## Usage
You can choose between these 2 methods to configure GHunt through the Companion extension :
- Method 1 => It gets the needed cookies, encodes them in base64 and puts them into your clipboard.
- Method 2 (fastest) => It gets the needed cookies, and send it to GHunt (who should be in listening on port 60067).

## Installation
I wait until extension is approved in the Firefox, Chrome, Edge and Opera store, and I'll be updating the Readme.
